Final Visualization Project

*Statement of Work* Using Salesforce reports, my final project will attempt to identify patterns in Successful Email Activities based on Sales Person Industry and Tenure. 

*Problem Statement*  Historically, our direct sales team has relied on the telephone.  As technology changes we are beginning to invest in our online presense.  This includes a more robust use of email.  Our sales teams work across different industry verticals, and our sales colleagues are ranging in their tenure with First American.  Some colleagues are having great success with email communication, while others find the phone call to be the best method of outreach.  As a business, we have not yet explored the Successful Email Data.  This project will just begin to scratch the surface.

*Technical Objective*  Using Salesforce, Miscrosoft Excel and R Studio, I will create a dashboard and narrative about Successful Email Activities at First American.
